<br><h>Climate Change’s Effect on Natural Disasters in the US</h>
<br><p> Idioms: </p>
    <p>Interface: Our scrolly telling visualization allows the user to scroll through a set of visualizations that detail the economic and human tolls of climate change. Each visualization is linked together in the same html file, and as the user scrolls different sections of text and visualizations change opacity to center in the middle of the screen. </p>
 
   <p>Implemented Visualizations: The first three visualizations are static and do not change with user input. They are used to reflect the overall trend of climate change in a positive direction, as well as to set up the idea that the economic and human toll of climate change is going in the same direction. The fourth visualization is a cluster chart that the user is able to change by scrolling down the page. This visualization has some really fun animations that show the movement of states over time, trending towards bigger fires, as opposed to smaller fires. The fifth visualization is a treemap that shows the steady increase in the amount of tornadoes that each state has in a five year period. This chart is interactable by hovering the mouse over a given rectangle, and it shows the amount of tornadoes in that state, as well as the time period. The final visualization shows the path of a hurricane through the US, by scrolling further, the user is able to see the path of six hurricanes, each increasing in intensity as years go by. Circles are drawn on the path of the hurricane and are colored depending on the category of the storm.</p>
   <p>Views: All views are built on the same page, and as the user scrolls down the page, the opacity of certain text and visualizations change depending on how far the user scrolls. The page is divided into different zones, and when the user enters a new zone, global variables are changed, as well as the opacity of the visualization allowing for a smooth transition between each section. </p>
    <p>Reflection: Project Development: We started working on the project by first figuring out what set of data we wanted to work with. We decided early on that we should attempt to find a topic that has a lot of data available on Kaggle and climate change was our first idea. Luckily there were many different datasets that we were able to pick through. Our initial idea was to focus on natural disasters, as we had this meeting within a week or so of hurricane Ian passing through Florida, so the devastation it wrought was still being streamed on television. Once we had the idea to focus on climate change’s effect on natural disasters we tossed around ideas on what natural disasters were related to climate change and chart ideas that would fit each type of disaster. We assigned a chart or two to each teammate to meet our quota of 6 total visualizations, and began working on our visualizations separately, which would come back to bite us near the end of this project. None of us had assumed that scrolly telling would be so complicated to code, so it took substantial effort in the final stretch of the project to completely combine our visualizations.</p>
     <p>Proposal and Changes: Originally we had wanted to create a grouped pie chart that dynamically resized each pie according to some value, as well as change the contents of each pie. This turned out to be quite harder than initially thought, and was changed near the end of the project as it could not be implemented. Instead we replaced it with a treemap that resizes rectangles based on a value. The treemap shows the same general trend that we wanted to get across with the grouped pie chart, but does lose some of the visual flair that the grouped pie chart has. All other data visualizations went swimmingly, especially our innovative visualization which shows the path of a hurricane, as well as its category as it forms and makes landfall.</p>
      <p>What to do differently: It would have been better to work on the same index.html from the start, as well as clarify what global variable each of us were going to use. It turned into a mess near the end of the project as we scrambled to make our visualizations cooperate with each other on the same page. For instance, each of us used similar svg names, so when we used the same index.html file, a lot of things started to fall apart. We should have also implemented the scrolly telling element first, instead of last as there were issues in formatting that we didn’t sort out until the deadline of the project. </p>
    <p>Data Descriptions: The data that our group collected is as follows,

Natural Disasters: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brsdincer/all-natural-disasters-19002021-eosdis<br>

Hurricane Dataset: https://ibtracs.unca.edu/index.php?name=v04r00-2021239N17281#all<br>
Tornado Dataset: https://www.spc.noaa.gov/wcm/#jmc => 1950-2021_actual_tornadoes.csv (7.2 mb)</p><br>
     <p>Data Processing: For the wildfire visualization, the data was originally in a sqlite file. The file was opened up using SQLite DB Browser. Using SQL commands, a new table was made and all the relevant information( Year, State, Fire Fize) was placed into that table. The table was then extracted into a CSV file for use in the project.
Specific columns were taken from the tornado data and converted into a csv file, which was then further refined into an easy to manage csv with five year periods added up for each state, which was finally transformed into a json file, as json is more friendly to hierarchy in d3, which the treemap uses. 
For the innovative visualization, the data was on Hurricane IDA from the IBTrACS website. The data was pulled from the website and converted into a CSV file manually.
For each of these datasets, the data was massive, with many redundant columns of data that were unneeded. In this case, the data was reformatted into only the data that we needed for each visualization.  </p>
    <p>Goals and Tasks:  The goal with our project is to first argue that increases in temperature have had a correlation with Natural Disasters. We wanted to show that within the last 50 or so years that our data sets have tracked that the costs in damages through Natural Disasters such as WildFiress, Hurricanes, Floods, and  Earthquakes to name a few have only scaled in severity. Our task was to create animated visulizatoins that users could interact with. Take for example Nick who created a Categorial Visualizatoin to show Natural Wildfires in the US from 0-10000 to 100,000 acres. </p>
    <p>Team Workload:
<br>Benjamin worked on the treemap, implemented the basic scrolly telling framework and collaborated with Christopher on the Readme and text for the html scrolly telling. 
<br>David worked on the innovative visualization which showed a hurricane’s path across the US, collaborated with Nick on merging all of the individual html files together, along with the js files. 
<br>Nick worked on the cluster chart, implementing the scrolly telling framework into the final project as well as collaborated with David on merging html and js files. 
<br>Christopher worked on a line, scatter and stacked bar chart, created the poster and collaborated with Benjamin on creating the text for the html page and Readme document. </p>
